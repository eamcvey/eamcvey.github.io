## Taking a little leap into the web3 future

I've contributed to the [ConstitutionDAO](https://www.constitutiondao.com/), an organization created to buy a copy of the Constitution. This is a web3 thing and involves a lot of new ideas and technologies I barely understand. This is the story of an ordinary person jumping into web3: what my experience was, what questions I have, and how it all turns out. 

## How I got here

One of my favorite podcasts is Brian Clark's [7 Figure Small](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/7-figure-small-with-brian-clark/id1017418913), about small scale entrepreneurship. This year it's been focused on explaining some basics of web3 technologies and what it might mean. The hosts encouraged people to dip their toes into web3 to understand how it's developing first hand. I like this approach, so I've been on the lookout for an opportunity to take a small step into ... something.

I also read Packy McCormick's newsletter [not boring](https://www.notboring.co/) about business and strategy. His long form articles often help me understand the dynamics of something new. This Monday's article was about the Constitution DAO. It explained this crazy project that was only a few days old: a bunch of people decided to form a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) to raise funds and _bid on a copy of the U.S. Constitution_ that is up for auction and Sotheby's. If they won, the goal would be to have it displayed in a public location. 

They only had 7 days left, but a lot of expertise on the initial organizing team (these are _not_ particularly ordinary folks). I had just enough understanding of crypto, blockchain, DAOs, and tokens from the podcast to be able to understand very roughly how this might work.

I decided this was my time to jump in. I was willing to lose my contribution for the sake of my education if things didn't go well. 

## Making the contribution

Making a contribution required buying some ETH, setting up a Metamask wallet, and connecting to the Juicebox site. The DAO website had a good instructional video, and everything went smoothly. My contribution was in, and I've been watching the site the last few days to see the total contributions rise exponentially from a few million when I contributed to nearly *$28 million* less than 48 hours later as I write this. Whatever this thing is, it's getting traction.

## I have questions

I jumped into this with lots of questions left unanswered - some about this particular project; some more general (this is the experiential learning I was after!). As I write this, it's November 17th. The auction is tomorrow, so I don't know how things are going to turn out yet - either with the bid, or with the process that follows. I'll learn the answers to some of these questions as things progress, but this is what I'm wondering right now:

I'm pretty sure how this is supposed to work is that the DAO bids at Sotheby's. If we win, any excess funds should be proportionally returned to the contributors' wallets. If we lose, all funds should be returned, and we'll all only be out the gas fees that come with any ETH transaction. There are some prominent people involved with this project, so I trust this will happen as expected because their reputations are at stake. But...

**Q: Is this all hinging on the trustworthiness of this group or is there a smart contract involved somehow? And what about the third parties? (i.e. Juicebox) — if the amount of money is large enough, could they decide it’s worth taking it and running? What’s preventing that?**

**Q: If there _is/were_ a smart contract involved here, how would I know exactly what it is and whether it’s valid? How is it communicated? Who verifies it? (Maybe everyone _can_ because blockchain, but who _does_, and can I trust them?) How would the successful purchase of the constitution be encoded and triggered by smart contract code?**

My understanding is that, if we have the winning bid, contributors will receive ConstitutionDAO-specific tokens that will verify us as contributors and give us the right to participate in governance decisions. *Q: How is this going to work?? Proportional voting?*

There's a Discord server for this project that has a link to an FAQ Google doc. I know a bit about Discord (thanks to education from my 9 year old) but still fumble around. **Q: Was there more info on the Discord that I could have accessed?** Might need to ask the kid.

## Bigger picture questions

This was a learning experience, and it's gotten me thinking about some of the implications of web3. I've been excited about the potential for good but, since humans are involved, there will surely be new forms of abuse too.

**Q: Now that people have seen raising a huge amount is possible, even if the ConstitutionDQO leaders are trustworthy, could it inspire others to scam people?** 

**Q: Is a non-representative collective really more functional and stable than our traditional forms of governance? Why?**

**Q: Would this have been possible without the involvement of well connected tech/VC folks (or will it be in the near future)? Will this tech just amplify existing inequality or empower people more broadly?**

## Stay tuned...

I'm looking forward to seeing what happens tomorrow and beyond! I'll update this as things unfold.
