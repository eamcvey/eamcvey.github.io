## Taking a little leap into the web3 future

I've contributed to the [ConstitutionDAO](https://www.constitutiondao.com/), an organization created to buy a copy of the Constitution. This is a web3 thing and involves a lot of new ideas and technologies I barely understand. This is the story of an ordinary person jumping into web3: what my experience was, what questions I have, and how it all turns out. 

## How I got here

One of my favorite podcasts is Brian Clark's [7 Figure Small](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/7-figure-small-with-brian-clark/id1017418913), about small scale entrepreneurship. This year it's been focused on explaining some basics of web3 technologies and what it might mean. The hosts encouraged people to dip their toes into web3 to understand how it's developing first hand. I like this approach, so I've been on the lookout for an opportunity to take a small step into ... something.

I also read Packy McCormick's newsletter [not boring](https://www.notboring.co/) about business and strategy. His long form articles often help me understand the dynamics of something new. This Monday's article was about the Constitution DAO. It explained this crazy project that was only a few days old: a bunch of people decided to form a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) to raise funds and _bid on a copy of the U.S. Constitution_ that is up for auction and Sotheby's. If they won, the goal would be to have it displayed in a public location. 

They only had 7 days left, but a lot of expertise on the initial organizing team (these are _not_ particularly ordinary folks). I had just enough understanding of crypto, blockchain, DAOs, and tokens from the podcast to be able to understand very roughly how this might work.

I decided this was my time to jump in. I was willing to lose my contribution for the sake of my education if things didn't go well. 

## Making the contribution

Making a contribution required buying some ETH, setting up a Metamask wallet, and connecting to the Juicebox site. The DAO website had a good instructional video, and everything went smoothly. My contribution was in, and I've been watching the site the last few days to see the total contributions rise exponentially from a few million when I contributed to nearly *$28 million* less than 48 hours later as I write this. Whatever this thing is, it's getting traction. (Update: the final amount raised was around $47 million - not surprisingly, it was exponential).

## I have questions

I jumped into this with lots of questions left unanswered - some about this particular project; some more general (this is the experiential learning I was after!). As I write this, it's November 17th. The auction is tomorrow, so I don't know how things are going to turn out yet - either with the bid, or with the process that follows. I'll learn the answers to some of these questions as things progress, but this is what I'm wondering right now:

I'm pretty sure how this is supposed to work is that the DAO bids at Sotheby's. If we win, any excess funds should be proportionally returned to the contributors' wallets. If we lose, all funds should be returned, and we'll all only be out the gas fees that come with any ETH transaction. There are some prominent people involved with this project, so I trust this will happen as expected because their reputations are at stake. But...

**Q: Is this all hinging on the trustworthiness of this group or is there a smart contract involved somehow? And what about the third parties? (i.e. Juicebox) — if the amount of money is large enough, could they decide it’s worth taking it and running? What’s preventing that?**

**Q: If there _is/were_ a smart contract involved here, how would I know exactly what it is and whether it’s valid? How is it communicated? Who verifies it? (Maybe everyone _can_ because blockchain, but who _does_, and can I trust them?) How would the successful purchase of the constitution be encoded and triggered by smart contract code?**

My understanding is that, if we have the winning bid, contributors will receive ConstitutionDAO-specific tokens that will verify us as contributors and give us the right to participate in governance decisions. *Q: How is this going to work?? Proportional voting?*

There's a Discord server for this project that has a link to an FAQ Google doc. I know a bit about Discord (thanks to education from my 9 year old) but still fumble around. Understanding how Discord works (which is like understanding how Slack works, but more so) is a useful base skill for getting involved in anything web3.

## Bigger picture questions

This was a learning experience, and it's gotten me thinking about some of the implications of web3. I've been excited about the potential for good but, since humans are involved, there will surely be new forms of abuse too.

**Q: Now that people have seen raising a huge amount is possible, even if the ConstitutionDQO leaders are trustworthy, could it inspire others to scam people?** 

**Q: Is a non-representative collective really more functional and stable than our traditional forms of governance? Why?**

**Q: Would this have been possible without the involvement of well connected tech/VC folks (or will it be in the near future)? Will this tech just amplify existing inequality or empower people more broadly?**

## Epilogue

As you know if you pay attention to the news, we lost our bid. While this is disappointing, it was still a great learning experience as I expected. In terms of the bid itself, it was a bit anti-climatic due to no one in the ConstitutionDAO community knowing who was bidding on our behalf in the auction. So all the excitement devolved into mass confusion and misinformation, though it was resolved in less than 30 minutes. There was also some surprise that we hadn't bid higher, since we had more funds, but the organizers attributed this to the Sotheby's cut and the expenses needed to properly secure the document if we had won. We were outbid by a hedge fund exec, who makes a fitting nemesis for a DAO.

Some takeaways:

+ **I was able to get my refund**. It was a bit confusing, demonstrating how this tech needs to evolve further before it's adopted more broadly, but it worked. This was not a scam.

+ Human behavior carries over to web3 (surprise!!). There is a mix of good and bad bevavior on the ConstitutionDAO Discord server. Shortly after the bid, many people jumped in and trashed the organizers, suggesting they mishandled the operation or were enriching themselves by buying more tokens after the bid concluded. This is similar to how people often treat leaders in non-web3 contexts, but as usual the relative anonymity of the internet makes it worse. I was glad to see that after the initial flood of trash, others jumped in to provide much more constructive thoughts.

+ Like other organizations, the DAO had to have designated leaders to function. If the Discord server hadn't had a locked-down announcements channel, total chaos would have ensued. The need to decide who controls this channel seems to constitute official leadership, which I think implies a natural limit to decentralization. It will be really interesting to see how DAOs evolve, how they compare to traditional organizations, and where we find them preferable. It brings to mind the Churchill quote about democracy being the worst form of government except all the others. DAOs are no silver bullet, but depending on the situation and the alternatives (and perhaps how our traditional institutions weather the current storms), they may be the best bad option.

+ Some people seemed to be in anything crypto related for speculative purposes, despite the organizers making clear that was not at all the intent. In the refund era, many people are saying they can claim their tokens and get 10x the amount of ETH for them on Uniswap rather than just getting their direct ETH refund. I don't know if this is true and if it is, I don't see why it should be. I'm following Brian Clark's solid suggestion to focus on where web3 solves a real problem and provide value, and avoid things that don't make sense or smell like Ponzi schemes.

+ Gas fees are no joke. Mine were roughly $56 to transfer my $200 contribution and $37 to get it back. They change every few seconds, so knowing when to expect lower gas fees and having the patience to wait for a favorable moment translates to dollars. I don't really understand gas fees well yet, but I'd like to. Consensus seems to be that they will drop in the future, and need to for this to be sustainable. 

+ The ConstitutionDAO got a lot of attention, and hopefully leads to moving web3 efforts forward in awareness and development in a constructive way. It is to be expected that many of the early efforts in web3 will look awkward in retrospect, as with the original internet, but this is how we progress.

+ I learned a lot of small and useful things just from going through this experience. For anyone interested in web3, I suggest finding a low-risk way to get involved.
